UTC is stored internally in guidebook's servers...so API will return times in UTC timezone

guide timezone


we are possibly ISO8601 compliant??

Notes about guaranteed return format

perhaps give the c print formatters used?


in iso notation??? 	yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.nnnnnn+|-hhmm

we suggest communicating strictly in UTC
