# Messages

## Creating an `Message`


```python
import requests

messages_list_url =  'https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/messages/'
api_key = 'API_KEY'
post_data =
{
	"guide": 1,
	"email": "open_api@example.com",
	"first_name": "Open API",
	"last_name": "Example User"
}
response = request.post(attendees_list_url, data=post_data, headers={'Authorization': 'JWT ' + api_key})

```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "id": 35,
  "guide": 415,
  "inbox": 204,
  "title": "Title of Message",
  "message": "Message created from the Open API",
  "scheduled_send_time": "2018-09-13T03:54:09.238987+0000"
}

```


This endpoint will create a `Message` that is in an `Inbox` that is in your `Guide`.  You can schedule the timing of when this `Message` will go live to your attendees.

## Listing `Messages`


```python
import requests

messages_url =  'https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/messages/'
api_key = 'API_KEY'

# This will return all messages you have access to
response = request.get(messages_url, headers={'Authorization': 'JWT ' + api_key})
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 38,
      "guide": 427,
      "inbox": 219,
      "title": "Message 1",
      "message": "Hello",
      "scheduled_send_time": "2018-09-13T04:31:41.137633+0000"
    },
    {
      "id": 39,
      "guide": 427,
      "inbox": 219,
      "title": "Message 2",
      "message": "Hello Again",
      "scheduled_send_time": "2018-09-13T04:31:41.139402+0000"

    }
  ]
}
```


This endpoint can also be used to read data on `Messages`.  Typically, this endpoint is called with a `guide` filter such that it returns a list of `Messages` associated to a lone `Guide` object that is owned by you.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/messages/`

### Model Fields

The fields returned in the `GET` responses include an additionally field:

Parameter       | Type    | Description
---------       | ------- | -----------
id              | integer  | An unique identifier for your `Message`.


### Filtering data by `Guide` id and other fields

Including a query parameter `guide` allows you to filter for all `Messages` related to a `Guide` you have access to (`Guide` 47 in the following example):

`GET https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/messages/?guide=47`


## Retrieving an `Message`

To retrieve an individual `Message` object issue a `GET` request like:

`GET https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/messages/71/`

The above request will fetch data for the `Message` with the id 71.


## Updating `Message` info

You can update the title and message fields of your `Message` object.  However, you will lose edit functionality once the `scheduled_send_time` is passed.  Once your `Message` is sent out to `Attendees`, this action can not be undone.

To modify an existing `Message` object, issue a `PATCH` request like:

`PATCH https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/messages/71/`

You will only need to include the specific fields you are updating and not a full request body.


## Deleting an `Message`

To delete a particular `Message`, issue a `DELETE` request to the url that points to the specific `Message` you'd like deleted.  Be very careful about deleting `Messages` that have been sent.  The delete operation only removes the `Message` on the Guidebook side, users will retain the `Messages` they have downloaded on their devices.

`DELETE https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/messages/71/`
