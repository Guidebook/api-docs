# Guides

Many of the resources exposed by the Guidebook Open API relate to a class of objects called `Guide`. `Guide` objects are typically containers for the set of data related to an event like a conference. For example, if you were hosting a conference called, "Programmer Summit 2017" you would likely have one `Guide` object that contained the schedule for the conference, a list of speakers for that conference, and a list of users who you expect to attend the conference.

As of right now, `Guide` objects themselves are primarily managed via the [Guidebook Builder CMS](https://builder.guidebook.com) (and not via the Open API). Resources exposed by the Open API, however, will contain references to the id of `Guide` objects they belong to. For example, every `Session` object returned in the Open API will report the id of the one `Guide` that `Session` belongs to (e.g. `"guide": 1`). In general, resources cannot be transferred or otherwise shared amongst more than one `Guide` -- once a `Session` is created under a given `Guide` object, it lives under that `Guide` permanently and cannot be moved to a different `Guide`.
